# JavaScript Example for using Phaser Matter Collision Plugin

This is a JavaScript example project that makes use of the Phaser Matter Collision Plugin. It uses a webpack-based build system.

Note:
- If you are trying to copy this project and use it outside of this repository, you'll need to modify `package.json`. Yarn workspaces express dependencies like this `"phaser-matter-collision-plugin": "workspace:*"`, so you'll need to replace that with a version number.
