# JavaScript Example Without Modules for using Phaser Matter Collision Plugin

This is a JavaScript example project that makes use of the Phaser Matter Collision Plugin. It does not use modules. It simply includes JS via scripts. It is harder to maintain a project this way, but it is common to encounter Phaser projects like this, so this example serves as a reference.

If you use this as a template for a project, be sure to replace this line in `index.html`:

```html
<script src="../plugin/dist/phaser-matter-collision.js"></script>
```
